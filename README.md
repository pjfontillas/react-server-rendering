# React server rendering demo

First:

`npm install`

To render on the command line:

`make commandline`

And to run the demo server:

`make server`

Go to [http://localhost:3000/client-rendered](http://localhost:3000/client-rendered) to see plain old client rendered.
Then go to [http://localhost:3000/server-rendered](http://localhost:3000/server-rendered) to see it server rendered.

Try turning off JS and revisiting those URLs.

Also you can try running multiple tabs to see the live updating in the demo.
